## 💡 **Best Practices**

### When to Revise Picks
✅ **Good Reasons to Revise:**
- Correct typos in team names or predictions
- Update confidence based on late-breaking news
- Fix incorrect spreads or game dates
- Add more detailed reasoning/analysis
- Update prediction method (e.g., text-based → win probability)

❌ **Avoid These Revisions:**
- Changing predictions after games start (integrity concerns)
- Revising losing picks to winners (tracking accuracy)
- Major prediction changes without documentation in reasoning

### Revision Workflow
```
1. Generate initial picks using AI agent
2. Review and revise immediately for accuracy
3. Publish picks to users
4. Only make minor corrections after publication
5. Update results as games complete
6. Use statistics to track overall performance
```

### Data Integrity
- **Audit Trail**: All revisions update the `updated_at` timestamp
- **Change Tracking**: System logs what was changed and when
- **Validation**: Input sanitization prevents corrupted data
- **Rollback**: Failed operations don't leave partial updates

## 🛠 **Technical Details**
