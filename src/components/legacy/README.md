## üóëÔ∏è When to Delete These Files

These files can be safely deleted once:

1. ‚úÖ All new refactored versions are tested in production
2. ‚úÖ No rollback is needed
3. ‚úÖ Team is confident with new architecture
4. ‚úÖ At least 30 days have passed since deployment

**Recommendation**: Keep for 30-60 days after deployment, then delete.

- State management that was moved to hooks
- Complex logic that was simplified

But remember: **The new architecture is better in every way!**
