### Bug #3: Inverted Spread Picks (Road Favorites)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Evidence:** Road favorites correctly identified:
- Pittsburgh Steelers (away) marked as favorite ✓
- Los Angeles Rams (away) marked as favorite ✓

## 🐛 Bug Fix That Resolved the Issue

**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`  
**Line:** 346  
**Change:** `odds.total` → `validatedOdds.total`

**Root Cause:** Variable name mismatch when passing odds to `generateReasoning()` function. The odds validation refactoring created `validatedOdds` variable, but one reference still used the old `odds` variable name.

**Impact:** This single-character typo caused ALL predictions to fail after completing the Monte Carlo simulation, right before saving to database.

## 📋 Next Steps - SQL Verification Required

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to complete verification:

### 1. Check for NaN Values (Bug #4)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as nan_count 
FROM picks 
WHERE (week = 7 OR week = 8)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
AND (
  monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%' 
  OR game_info::text LIKE '%NaN%'
);
```
**Expected Result:** `nan_count: 0`

### 2. Verify All Predictions Have Edge Scores
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as predictions_with_edges 
FROM picks 
WHERE (week = 7 OR week = 8)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
AND monte_carlo_results->>'spread_probability' IS NOT NULL;
```
**Expected Result:** Should equal 28

### 3. Verify Road Favorite Spread Picks (Bug #3)
```sql
SELECT 
  game_info->>'away_team' as away_team,
  game_info->>'home_team' as home_team,
  game_info->>'favorite_team' as favorite,
  game_info->>'favorite_is_home' as fav_is_home,
  spread_prediction
FROM picks 
WHERE (week = 7 OR week = 8)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
AND game_info->>'favorite_is_home' = 'false'
ORDER BY game_info->>'game_date';
```
**Expected Result:** Spread predictions should favor the away team when `favorite_is_home = false`

### 4. Summary Report
```sql
SELECT 
  week,
  COUNT(*) as total_predictions,
  COUNT(monte_carlo_results) as with_monte_carlo,
  COUNT(spread_prediction) as with_spread,
  COUNT(ou_prediction) as with_ou
FROM picks 
WHERE (week = 7 OR week = 8)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```
