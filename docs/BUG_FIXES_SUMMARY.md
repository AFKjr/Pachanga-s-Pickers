# Bug Fixes Summary - October 15, 2025

## üéØ **All Critical & High Severity Bugs Fixed**

### ‚úÖ Bug #1: Fixed Undefined Moneyline Odds
**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`

**Problem:** `determineFavorite()` was receiving undefined moneyline odds, causing random game failures.

**Solution:** Added validation before calling `determineFavorite()`:
```typescript
// Validate moneyline odds exist before proceeding
if (odds.homeMLOdds === undefined || odds.awayMLOdds === undefined) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping ${game.away_team} @ ${game.home_team}: Missing moneyline odds`);
  errors.push({
    game: `${game.away_team} @ ${game.home_team}`,
    error: 'Missing moneyline odds - cannot determine favorite'
  });
  continue; // Skip this game gracefully
}
```

**Impact:** Games with missing moneyline odds now skip gracefully instead of crashing or producing invalid predictions.

### ‚úÖ Bug #2: Fixed Missing Spread/Total Odds
**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`

**Problem:** Spread and total odds could be undefined, causing NaN in Monte Carlo simulations.

**Solution:** Added safe defaults and warnings:
```typescript
// Provide safe defaults for optional odds
const homeSpread = odds.homeSpread ?? 0;
const total = odds.total ?? 45.0; // NFL average total

if (odds.homeSpread === undefined) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è No spread odds for ${game.away_team} @ ${game.home_team}, using 0`);
}
if (odds.total === undefined) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è No total odds for ${game.away_team} @ ${game.home_team}, using 45.0`);
}
```

**Impact:** Games with missing spread/total odds now use reasonable defaults instead of failing.

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #3: Fixed Incorrect Spread Pick Logic
**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`

**Problem:** Spread pick logic assumed `spreadCoverProbability` represented the home team, but it actually represents the favorite team after recent changes.

**Solution:** Updated logic to use `favoriteCoverProbability` and `favoriteInfo`:
```typescript
// Use favorite/underdog probabilities for correct spread pick
const pickFavorite = simResult.favoriteCoverProbability > 50;
const spreadPick = pickFavorite
  ? favoriteInfo.favoriteIsHome
    ? `${game.home_team} ${homeSpread > 0 ? '+' : ''}${homeSpread}`
    : `${game.away_team} ${-homeSpread > 0 ? '+' : ''}${-homeSpread}`
  : favoriteInfo.favoriteIsHome
    ? `${game.away_team} ${-homeSpread > 0 ? '+' : ''}${-homeSpread}`
    : `${game.home_team} ${homeSpread > 0 ? '+' : ''}${homeSpread}`;

const spreadProb = Math.max(simResult.favoriteCoverProbability, simResult.underdogCoverProbability);
```

**Impact:** Spread picks now correctly identify which team to bet on, regardless of home/away status.

### ‚úÖ Bug #4: Fixed NaN in drivesPerGame Calculation
**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/database/fetch-stats.ts`

**Problem:** If `drives_per_game`, `total_plays`, or `games_played` were null/undefined, calculation resulted in NaN.

**Solution:** Added null checks before calculation:
```typescript
drivesPerGame: dbStats.drives_per_game ?? 
  (dbStats.total_plays && dbStats.games_played 
    ? dbStats.total_plays / dbStats.games_played / 5.5 
    : 11.0), // NFL average drives per game
```

**Impact:** Stats calculations now always return valid numbers, preventing simulation failures.

### ‚úÖ Bug #5: Fixed Duplicate Week Calculation Functions
**Files:** 
- `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`
- `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/utils/nfl-utils.ts`

**Problem:** Two different functions (`getNFLWeekFromDate()` and `calculateNFLWeek()`) could produce different results for the same date.

**Solution:** 
1. Removed `calculateNFLWeek()` function
2. Updated all references to use `getNFLWeekFromDate()` consistently
3. Removed unused import

**Impact:** Week calculations are now consistent across the entire application.

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #6: Fixed Timezone Conversion Issues
**File:** `supabase/functions/generate-predictions/lib/generators/live-predictions.ts`

**Problem:** Manual EST conversion didn't account for Daylight Saving Time and could shift dates incorrectly.

**Solution:** Store UTC dates directly without conversion:
```typescript
// Store UTC date directly without manual timezone conversion
// The Odds API provides UTC timestamps, frontend will handle display timezone
const formattedDate = game.commence_time.split('T')[0];
```

**Impact:** Game dates are now stored accurately regardless of DST or timezone.

## üìä **Testing Results**

### Expected Improvements:
1. ‚úÖ **No More Random Game Count** - All valid games will be processed
2. ‚úÖ **Consistent Week Assignment** - All games use same week calculation
3. ‚úÖ **Accurate Spread Picks** - Correct team selected for spread bets
4. ‚úÖ **No More NaN Values** - All stats calculations return valid numbers
5. ‚úÖ **Correct Game Dates** - UTC dates stored without DST issues

### How to Verify:
1. Navigate to `/admin/generate` in your app
2. Click "Generate Predictions for Next 7 Days"
3. Check console logs for:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning messages for games with missing odds (these will be skipped)
   - ‚úÖ Success messages for all valid games
   - No error messages about undefined values or NaN

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Generate predictions for current week
- [ ] Verify all games with complete odds are processed

## üìù **Notes**

- All critical bugs that caused "random amount of games predicted" are now fixed
- The Odds API integration remains unchanged - we just handle missing data better
- Frontend timezone display should handle UTC dates correctly
- Edge calculations will be more accurate with corrected spread picks

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY FOR TESTING**
