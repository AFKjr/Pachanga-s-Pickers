## Ready for Import! ✅

The database schema is now fully aligned with the CSV parser. You can now:

1. ✅ Import Week 7 Offense CSV
2. ✅ Import Week 7 Defense CSV
3. ✅ All 54 fields will be populated correctly
4. ✅ Per-game calculations will be accurate
5. ✅ Turnover differential will be auto-calculated

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Import**: Upload the cleaned Week 7 CSVs
2. **Verify Data**: Run query to check sample team:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM team_stats_cache 
   WHERE team_name = 'Detroit Lions' 
   AND week = 7 
   AND season_year = 2025;
   ```
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any parsing errors in console
4. **Validate Stats**: Verify a few teams match source data
