Function deployed successfully!
```

If you get auth errors:
```powershell
# Login to Supabase
supabase login

supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

---

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

```powershell
# Watch logs in real-time
supabase functions logs generate-predictions --tail
```

Keep this terminal open to monitor the function execution.

---

### Step 4: Test Prediction Generation

1. **Open your admin panel:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/generate` (or your production URL)

2. **Generate predictions:**
   - Click "Generate Picks" button
   - Select current week (Week 7)
   - Trigger generation

3. **Watch the logs** in your terminal from Step 3

### Good Signs ✅
- ✅ "✓ Successfully generated prediction" for each game
- ✅ Warnings about missing odds (means fallback logic works)
- ✅ Warnings about default stats (means validation works)
- ✅ All games process without crashes
- ✅ Stats quality indicators appear

### Bad Signs ❌
- ❌ `TypeError: Cannot read property 'homeMLOdds' of undefined`
- ❌ `NaN` appearing anywhere in output
- ❌ Games failing to process
- ❌ Missing spread picks or inverted logic

---

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Database for Valid Data

```sql
-- Verify no NaN values exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as nan_count
FROM picks
WHERE 
  monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%'
  OR game_info::text LIKE '%NaN%';
-- Expected: 0

-- Check recent predictions
SELECT 
  game_info->>'home_team' as home,
  game_info->>'away_team' as away,
  game_info->>'spread' as spread,
  spread_prediction,
  monte_carlo_results->>'spread_probability' as prob,
  created_at
FROM picks
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
-- Expected: All rows with valid data, no NaN

-- Verify spread picks are correct
SELECT 
  game_info->>'home_team' as home,
  game_info->>'away_team' as away,
  game_info->>'favorite_team' as favorite,
  game_info->>'spread' as spread,
  spread_prediction,
  monte_carlo_results->>'favorite_cover_probability' as fav_prob
FROM picks
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
-- Expected: spread_prediction matches favorite when fav_prob > 50
```

### 2. Check Frontend Display

1. Navigate to home page: `http://localhost:5173/` (or production URL)
2. Verify predictions appear correctly
3. Check that:
   - Dates display correctly (no timezone shifts)
   - Spread picks make sense (favorite has negative spread)
   - Confidence percentages are reasonable (40-80% range)
   - No "NaN" or "undefined" visible

### 3. Test Edge Cases

#### Test Missing Odds
If you see warnings like:
```
⚠️ Missing moneyline odds for [Team] @ [Team]. 
   Estimated from spread: Home -XXX, Away +XXX
```
This is **GOOD** - it means the odds converter is working!

#### Test Missing Stats
If you see warnings like:
```
⚠️ Using default stats for [Team]
📊 Stats quality for [Team]: default (league_averages)
```
This is **GOOD** - it means stats validation is working!

#### Test Road Favorites
Find a game where the away team is favored:
- Spread should show away team with negative value
- Example: `Chiefs -7` (not `Raiders +7`) when Chiefs are away

- [ ] 0 NaN values in database
- [ ] All predictions visible in UI
- [ ] Warnings appear but don't stop processing

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Multiple weeks of predictions generated without issues
- [ ] No user reports of incorrect data
- [ ] Edge function logs show consistent behavior
- [ ] Database remains clean (no corrupted data)

### First Week
- [ ] Predictions accuracy tracking works
- [ ] Stats quality distribution looks reasonable
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] System handles API outages gracefully

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Function Won't Deploy

**Error:** `Authentication required`
```powershell
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

**Error:** `TypeScript compilation failed`
```powershell
npm run build
# Fix any errors shown, then redeploy
```

---

### Issue: Games Failing to Process

**Check logs for specific error:**
```powershell
supabase functions logs generate-predictions --tail
```

**Common causes:**
1. **Missing environment variables**
   - Check Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets
   - Required: `ODDS_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

2. **Database connection issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
   - Check RLS policies on `team_stats_cache` table

3. **API rate limits**
   - The Odds API has rate limits
   - Check response status codes in logs

---

### Issue: NaN Values Still Appearing

**This should NOT happen with our fixes, but if it does:**

1. **Identify the source:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     game_info,
     monte_carlo_results
   FROM picks
   WHERE 
     monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%'
     OR game_info::text LIKE '%NaN%'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Check the specific game's stats:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM team_stats_cache
   WHERE team_name = 'problematic-team-name';
   ```

3. **Add debugging:**
   In `fetch-stats.ts`, temporarily add:
   ```typescript
   console.log('DB Stats:', JSON.stringify(dbStats, null, 2));
   ```

---

### Issue: Spread Picks Look Wrong

**Example:** Chiefs @ Raiders with Chiefs -7, but pick shows "Raiders +7"

**Verify favoriteInfo is correct:**
1. Check logs for: `🏆 Favorite: [Team] (home/away)`
2. Compare with moneyline odds
3. If Chiefs have -200 ML, they should be favorite

**If issue persists:**
- Review `determineSpreadPick()` function
- Add debug logging:
  ```typescript
  console.log('Spread Pick Debug:', {
    favoriteIsHome: favoriteInfo.favoriteIsHome,
    favoriteCoverProb: simResult.favoriteCoverProbability,
    homeSpread: validatedOdds.homeSpread,
    pick: spreadPickResult.pick
  });
  ```

---

## 📈 Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Prediction Success Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result != 'pending') as completed,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'win') as wins,
     ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'win')::numeric / 
           NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result != 'pending'), 0) * 100, 2) as win_pct
   FROM picks
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
   ```

2. **Stats Quality Distribution**
   ```sql
   -- If you added metadata columns
   SELECT 
     home_stats_quality,
     away_stats_quality,
     COUNT(*) as predictions,
     AVG(stats_confidence) as avg_confidence
   FROM picks
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   GROUP BY home_stats_quality, away_stats_quality
   ORDER BY predictions DESC;
   ```

3. **Odds Estimation Frequency**
   Track how often you're using estimated odds vs real odds.
   Look for patterns in warnings.
