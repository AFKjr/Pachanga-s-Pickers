## üéØ What We're Testing

### Primary Goal
**Verify ALL Week 7 NFL games get predictions with edge scores calculated**

Expected outcome:
- 15-16 games processed (typical NFL week)
- All have spread/moneyline/total predictions
- Edge scores calculated for each pick type
- No crashes or errors

### Bug-Specific Tests

| Bug | What to Check | How to Verify |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| #1: Undefined ML Odds | Games process even without moneyline | Check logs for "Estimated from spread" warnings |
| #2: Missing Spread/Total | Defaults used when odds missing | Check logs for "Using pick'em (0)" warnings |
| #3: Spread Pick Logic | Road favorites have correct picks | Find away favorite, verify spread shows away team |
| #4: NaN in Stats | No NaN anywhere | Run SQL: `WHERE monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%'` |
| #5: Week Calculation | All games assigned to Week 7 | Check `week` column in database |
| #6: Timezone Issues | Dates correct | Sunday games show Sunday date, not Monday |
| #7: Stats Validation | Quality tracked | Check logs for quality indicators |

## üìä Quick Verification Steps

### 1. Generate Predictions (In Browser)
- Go to admin panel: http://localhost:5173/admin/generate
- Click "Generate Picks"
- Select "Week 7"
- Click generate button
- **Wait for completion message**

### 2. Check Supabase Dashboard Logs
- URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wbfvfzrxdqwrnqmpnfel/functions
- Click `generate-predictions`
- View "Logs" tab
- Look for success/error messages

### 3. Run Database Query (Supabase SQL Editor)
```sql
-- Quick verification query
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_picks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT game_info->>'home_team') as teams,
  MAX(created_at) as most_recent,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ Predictions exist'
    ELSE '‚ùå No predictions found'
  END as status
FROM picks
WHERE week = 7
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours';
```

### 4. Check for NaN Values (Critical!)
```sql
-- Must return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) as nan_count
FROM picks
WHERE week = 7
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
  AND (
    monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%'
    OR game_info::text LIKE '%NaN%'
  );
```

### 5. Verify Edge Scores Exist
```sql
-- All should have values
SELECT 
  game_info->>'home_team' || ' vs ' || game_info->>'away_team' as game,
  monte_carlo_results->>'spread_probability' as spread_edge,
  monte_carlo_results->>'moneyline_probability' as ml_edge,
  monte_carlo_results->>'total_probability' as total_edge,
  CASE 
    WHEN monte_carlo_results->>'spread_probability' IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ'
    ELSE '‚ùå'
  END as has_edges
FROM picks
WHERE week = 7
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
LIMIT 10;
```
