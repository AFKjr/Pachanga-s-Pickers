## Dashboard Access

You can monitor your function in the Supabase Dashboard:
**[View Function Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wbfvfzrxdqwrnqmpnfel/functions)**

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Deployment

Go to your admin panel and generate predictions:
- URL: `http://localhost:5173/admin/generate` (or your production URL)
- Click "Generate Picks"
- Select Week 7
- Click generate

### 2. Monitor in Dashboard

Check the Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to the [Functions page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wbfvfzrxdqwrnqmpnfel/functions)
2. Click on `generate-predictions`
3. View the "Logs" tab to see execution logs
4. Look for the expected output patterns

### 3. Verify Database

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check for NaN values (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) as nan_count
FROM picks
WHERE 
  monte_carlo_results::text LIKE '%NaN%'
  OR game_info::text LIKE '%NaN%';

-- View recent predictions
SELECT 
  game_info->>'home_team' as home,
  game_info->>'away_team' as away,
  game_info->>'spread' as spread,
  spread_prediction,
  monte_carlo_results->>'spread_probability' as prob,
  created_at
FROM picks
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Check Frontend

1. Navigate to your homepage
2. Verify predictions appear correctly
3. Check that:
   - No "NaN" or "undefined" values visible
   - Spread picks make sense
   - Dates display correctly
   - Confidence percentages are reasonable

## Expected Behavior

### Good Signs ‚úÖ
You should see in the logs:
```
‚úì Successfully generated prediction for [Team] @ [Team]
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing moneyline odds for [Team] @ [Team]. Estimated from spread...
‚ö†Ô∏è Using default stats for [Team]
üìä Stats quality for [Team]: real (database)
```

### Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è
If you see:
- `TypeError: Cannot read property...` - Something isn't fixed
- `NaN` appearing in output - Bug #4 not resolved
- Games failing to process - Check environment variables

---

## Troubleshooting

### Function Not Working

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Go to: Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions
   - Verify these are set:
     - `ODDS_API_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_URL`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     - `WEATHER_API_KEY` (optional)

2. **Check Function Logs**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí generate-predictions ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for specific error messages

3. **Test with Postman/Thunder Client**
   ```
   POST https://wbfvfzrxdqwrnqmpnfel.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-predictions
   Headers:
     Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY
   Body:
     { "mode": "live" }
   ```

### Database Issues

If predictions aren't appearing:

```sql
-- Check if picks table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM picks;

-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'picks';
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

If critical issues arise:

```powershell
# In your terminal
git log --oneline -5  # Find previous commit hash
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
npx supabase functions deploy generate-predictions
git checkout main  # Return to current version
```

- [ ] All games process without crashes
- [ ] No NaN values in database
- [ ] Spread picks are correct (favorite has negative spread)
- [ ] Warnings appear but don't block processing
- [ ] Frontend displays predictions properly
- [ ] User can generate multiple weeks without issues
