## How It Works

Navigate to **Admin Panel ‚Üí Manage Picks** and click **Edit** on any pick card.

### 2. Manual Odds Entry Section

#### **Moneyline Odds**
- **Home Team Odds**: e.g., `-150` (favorite) or `+130` (underdog)
- **Away Team Odds**: e.g., `+130` (underdog) or `-150` (favorite)

#### **Spread Odds**

## Edge Calculation Formula

**Edge = Model Probability - Implied Probability from Odds**

### Example Calculation:

**Scenario:** Cincinnati Bengals moneyline pick
- **Monte Carlo Win Probability**: 66.8% (from simulation)
- **Moneyline Odds**: `+215` (underdog odds)
- **Implied Probability**: ~31.7% (from +215 odds)
- **Edge**: 66.8% - 31.7% = **+35.1%** ‚úÖ (Strong bet!)

- `-150`: Bet $150 to win $100 (60% implied probability)
- `-200`: Bet $200 to win $100 (66.7% implied probability)

### Underdog Odds (Positive Numbers)

Under: -110
```

### 2. **Line Shopping**
Compare odds from different sportsbooks and enter the best available:
```
DraftKings: -110 spread
FanDuel: -105 spread  ‚Üê Enter this one (better value)
```

### 3. **Odds Movement Tracking**
Update odds as lines move throughout the week:
```
Monday: Chiefs -7 (-110)
Friday: Chiefs -5.5 (-110)  ‚Üê Update for edge recalculation
```

### 4. **Live Odds Updates**
Update odds close to game time for accurate edge calculations:
```
Game time approaching: Update to latest odds from sportsbook
```

## Edge Interpretation

### üü¢ **Strong Bet (Edge ‚â• +3%)**
- Model significantly favors your pick over market odds
- Example: +5.2% edge = Model sees 5.2% more value than bookmaker
- **Action**: Strong recommendation to bet

### üü° **Decent Bet (Edge +1% to +3%)**
- Moderate value found
- Example: +2.1% edge = Slight model advantage
- **Action**: Consider betting with proper bankroll management

### ‚ö™ **Neutral (Edge 0% to +1%)**
- Minimal edge, close to market consensus
- Example: +0.5% edge = Very small advantage
- **Action**: Pass or small bet only

### üî¥ **Avoid (Edge < 0%)**
- Negative edge = Betting against value
- Example: -2.3% edge = Model disagrees with pick
- **Action**: Avoid this bet

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
Odds are stored in `picks` table ‚Üí `game_info` JSONB column:
```json
{
  "home_ml_odds": -150,
  "away_ml_odds": 130,
  "spread_odds": -110,
  "over_odds": -110,
  "under_odds": -110
}
```

### Edge Calculation Code
Located in: `src/utils/edgeCalculator.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateEdge(modelProb, americanOdds)`: Core edge calculation
- `oddsToImpliedProbability(americanOdds)`: Convert odds to probability
- `calculatePickEdges(pick, monteCarloResults, gameInfo)`: Calculate all three edge types

### Automatic Recalculation
When odds are updated:

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Enter odds from your preferred sportsbook for accurate edge
- Update odds close to game time for best accuracy
- Double-check odds format (negative for favorites, positive for underdogs)
- Use standard -110 for spread/O/U if unsure (most common)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Don't enter decimal odds (use American odds only)
- Don't forget negative sign for favorites (e.g., `-150` not `150`)
- Don't leave blank if odds exist (enter `0` or valid odds)
- Don't update odds after game starts (defeats edge calculation purpose)

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have odds for a game?**  
A: You can leave odds fields blank. Edge will show as 0% until odds are added.

**Q: Do I need to re-run Monte Carlo simulation after updating odds?**  
A: No! Edge recalculates automatically using existing Monte Carlo probabilities.

**Q: What odds format should I use?**  
A: American odds only (e.g., -110, +150). System doesn't support decimal or fractional.

**Q: Can I update odds for past games?**

**Q: Where do edge values display?**  
A: Pick cards show edge percentages and color-coded confidence bars on frontend.

**Q: What if odds change after I enter them?**  
A: Simply edit the pick again and update the odds. Edge recalculates on save.
